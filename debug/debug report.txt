Issues in the code

Issue 1: Using await Posts.find() without sorting at the database level

It uses await Posts.find() without sorting and then attempts to sort in memory.

This approach can be dangerous and inefficient with large datasets.

Sorting in JavaScript after retrieval can produce inconsistent or duplicate results if find() is called while data is being concurrently updated.

Solution
Order in the database query js
const posts = await Posts.find().sort({ created: -1 });


Issue 3: Lack of error handling

In the case of a database issue, the application can hang unresponsive or crash.

2. Solutions

Implement error handling js
async function getSortedPosts(req, res) {

try {

const posts = await Posts.find().sort({ created: -1 }); 
res.json(posts); 

} catch (err) {

console.error('Error fetching posts:', err); 

res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch posts' }); 
}

Issue 3: Fetching all the posts is not scalable, especially when dealing with large datasets.
There can 1000s of posts in the database, and fetching all of them at once can be inefficient.

Solution:
Use pagination to limit the number of posts fetched at once.
